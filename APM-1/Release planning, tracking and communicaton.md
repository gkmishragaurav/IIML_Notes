### Q. Why Release Planning is Essential?
- Release planning is the process of creating a very high-level plan that covers a period longer than an iteration. A typical release will cover perhaps three to six months and maybe three to twelve or more iterations, depending on how long
the iterations are.
- It helps the product owner and the whole team decide how much must be developed and how long that will take before they have a releasable product.The sooner the product can be released (and the better it is when it’s released), the sooner the organization will begin earning a return on their investment in the project.
- A release conveys expectations about what is likely to be developed and in what timeframe. Many organizations need this information because it feeds into other strategic planning activities.
- A release plan serves as a guidepost toward which the project team can progress. Without the concept of a release, teams move endlessly from one iteration to the next. A release plan provides context that allows iterations to combine into a satisfying whole. 

### The Release Plan:
- The general steps to planning a release are shown in Figure
  - Determine the Conditions of Satisfaction:
    - Before starting to plan a release, it is important to know the criteria by which the project will be evaluated as a success or a failure. For most projects, the ultimate scorecard is the amount of money saved or generated. As leading indicators of whether a project is likely to achieve these financial goals, most projects use the triumvirate of schedule, scope, and resources. 
  - Estimate The User Stories:
    - Because an estimate represents the cost of developing a user story, it is important that each has been estimated. 
    - It is not necessary to estimate everything that a product owner may ever want. It is only necessary to have an estimate for each new feature that has some reasonable possibility of being selected for inclusion in the upcoming release.
    - Often, a product owner will have a wish list that extends two, three, or more releases into the future. It is not necessary to have estimates on the more distant work.
  - Select an Iteration Length:
    - Most agile teams work in iterations of from one to four weeks. It’s possible to go slightly longer and some teams have experimented with even shorter iterations. When planning a release, an appropriate iteration length will need to be chosen.
  - Estimate Velocity:
    - If the team has experience working together, your best bet is often to use the velocity the team exhibited most recently. Naturally, if the technology or business domain changed dramatically, it may not be appropriate to use a team’s past velocity. Still, there are techniques you can apply that enable you to make an informed estimate of velocity based on past results. 
  - Prioritize User Stories:
    - Most projects have either too little time or too many features. It is often impossible to do everything that everyone wants in the time allowed. Because of this, the product owner must prioritize the features she wants developed. 
    - A good product owner will accept ultimate responsibility for prioritizing, but will listen to advice from the development team, especially about sequencing.
  - Select Stories And A Date:
    - you have an estimate of the team’s velocity per iteration and have an assumption about how many iterations there will be. It’s time to see if a release can be planned that meets the conditions of satisfaction for the project.
      - If the project is feature-driven, we can sum the estimates of all needed features and divide by the expected velocity. This will give us the number of iterations necessary to complete the desired functionality.
      - If the project is date-driven, we can determine the number of iterations by looking at a calendar. Multiplying the number of iterations by the expected velocity will tell us how many story points or ideal days will fit in the release. We can count off that many points or ideal days into the prioritized list of user stories and see how much functionality can be delivered in the desired time.
    - The next question to be addressed regards how detailed the release plan will be. Some teams in some environments prefer to create a release plan that shows what they expect to develop during each iteration. Other teams prefer simply to determine what they think will be developed during the overall release, leaving the specifics of each iteration for later. This is something to be discussed and decided during release planning.
    - Because there is a lot of give-and-take and what-if questions during a typical release planning session, we want an easy way to manipulate what’s in and out of the release and its iterations. The best way of achieving this, assuming everyone is collocated, is to work with 3” x 5” note cards or sticky pads with user stories or features written on them.
      - To plan a release, the product owner selects her top priority items that will fit in the first iteration. Cards are stacked or arranged to indicate which stories comprise each iteration. 
      - Cards can be arranged like this on a table or a wall. If you’re using a wall, a cork board is very effective because cards can be pinned to the board, rather than taped to the wall.
