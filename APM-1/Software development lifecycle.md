## Notes

### What we are going to learn?
	- Implementing agile approaches at a project or team level
	- Coverage of most popular agile approaches, as listed in industry surveys
	- Suitability factors to consider when choosing an agile approach and/or practice
	- Mapping agile to PMBOK® Guide processes and Knowledge Areas
	- Discussion on the use of agile beyond software development
	- Guidance, techniques, and approaches to consider when implementing agile in projects or organizations

### The Agile Manifesto: Notes start for day-1
	Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
	Working software over comprehensive documentation
	Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
	Responding to change over following a plan


### Based on above agile Manifesto, we have 12 principles

### Note:
	- Based on above Principles we can have many practices. Is agile an approach, a method, a practice, a technique, or a framework? Answer is any of this can be applied based on the situation. So agile is a blanket term for many approaches.
	- In general, there are two strategies to fulfill agile values and principles. The first is to adopt a formal agile approach, intentionally designed and proven to achieve desired results. Then take time to learn and understand the agile approaches before changing or tailoring them. Premature and haphazard tailoring can minimize the effects of the approach and thus limit benefits. 
	- The second strategy is to implement changes to project practices in a manner that fits the project context to achieve progress on a core value or principle. Use timeboxes to create features, or specific techniques to iteratively refine features. Consider dividing up one large project into several releases, if that works for the specific project context. Implement changes that will help the project succeed—the changes do not need to be part of the organization’s formal practices. The end goal is not to be agile for its own sake, but rather to deliver a continuous flow of value to customers and achieve better business outcomes.

### LEAN AND THE KANBAN METHOD:
	- One way to think about the relationship between lean, agile, and the Kanban Method is to consider agile and the Kanban Method as descendants of lean thinking. In other words, lean thinking is a superset, sharing attributes with agile and Kanban.
	- This shared heritage is very similar and focuses on delivering value, respect for people, minimizing waste, being transparent, adapting to change, and continuously improving. 
	- Project teams sometimes find it useful to blend various methods—whatever works for the organization or team is what should be done regardless of its origin. The objective is the best outcome regardless of the approach used.

### UNCERTAINTY, RISK, AND LIFE CYCLE SELECTION:
	- Some projects have considerable uncertainty around project requirements and how to fulfill those requirements using current knowledge and technology. These uncertainties can contribute to high rates of change and project complexity. 
	- As project uncertainty increases, so too does the risk of rework and the need to use a different approach. To mitigate the impact of these risks, teams select life cycles that allow them to tackle projects with high amounts of uncertainty via small increments of work.
	- Teams can plan and manage projects with clear and stable requirements and clear technical challenges with little difficulty. However, as the uncertainty in the project increases, the likelihood of changes, wasted work, and rework also increases, which is costly and time consuming.
	- Some teams have evolved project life cycles to use iterative and incremental approaches. Many teams discover that when they explore the requirements iteratively and deliver more often incrementally, the teams adapt to changes more easily. These iterative and incremental approaches reduce waste and rework because the teams gain feedback. These approaches use:
		* Very short feedback loops,
		* Frequent adaptation of process,
		* Reprioritization,
		* Regularly updated plans, and
		* Frequent delivery.

### charecterstics of project lifecycle:
	- It is important to note that all projects have these characteristics—no project is completely devoid of considerations around requirements, delivery, change, and goals. A project’s inherent characteristics determine which life cycle is the best fit for that project.
	- No life cycle can be perfect for all projects. Instead, each project finds a spot on the continuum that provides an optimum balance of characteristics for its context.

### CHARACTERISTICS OF PREDICTIVE LIFE CYCLES:
	- Predictive life cycles expect to take advantage of high certainty around firm requirements, a stable team, and low risk. As a result, project activities often execute in a serial manner
	- In order to achieve this approach, the team requires detailed plans to know what to deliver and how. These projects succeed when other potential changes are restricted. Team leaders aim to minimize change for the predictive project.
	- When the team creates detailed requirements and plans at the beginning of the project, they can articulate the constraints. The team can then use those constraints to manage risk and cost. As the team progresses through the detailed plan, they monitor and control changes that might affect the scope, schedule, or budget.
	- By emphasizing a departmentally efficient, serialized sequence of work, predictive projects do not typically deliver business value until the end of the project. 
	- If the predictive project encounters changes or disagreements with the requirements, or if the technological solution is no longer straightforward, the predictive project will incur unanticipated costs.

### CHARACTERISTICS OF ITERATIVE LIFE CYCLES:
	- Iterative life cycles improve the product or result through successive prototypes or proofs of concept. Each new prototype yields new stakeholder feedback and team insights. Then, the team incorporates the new information by repeating one or more project activities in the next cycle. 
	- Teams may use timeboxing on a given iteration for a few weeks, gather insights, and then rework the activity based on those insights. In that way, iterations help identify and reduce uncertainty in the project.
	- Projects benefit from iterative life cycles when complexity is high, when the project incurs frequent changes, or when the scope is subject to differing stakeholders’ views of the desired final product. Iterative life cycles may take longer because they are optimized for learning rather than speed of delivery

### CHARACTERISTICS OF INCREMENTAL LIFE CYCLES
	- Some projects optimize for speed of delivery. Many businesses and initiatives cannot afford to wait for everything to be completed; in these cases, customers are willing to receive a subset of the overall solution. This frequent delivery of smaller deliverables is called an incremental life cycle.
	- Incremental life cycles optimize work for delivering value to sponsors or customers more often than a single, final product. 
	- Teams plan initial deliverables before beginning their work, and they begin working on that first delivery as soon as possible. Some agile projects deliver value within days of project initiation. Others could take longer, ranging from 1 week to several weeks.
	- As the project continues, the team may deviate from the original vision. The team can manage the deviations, because the team delivers value sooner. The degree of change and variation is less important than ensuring customers get value sooner than at the end of the project.
	- For example, builders may want to show a finished room or floor of a building before they continue with the remainder of the building. In that case, they may complete a floor with fixtures, paint, and everything else intended for the finished floor before proceeding to the next floor. The customer is able to see and approve of the style, color, and other details, allowing adjustments to be made before further investments of time and money are made. This reduces potential rework and/or customer dissatisfaction.
