## Notes

### What we are going to learn?
	- Implementing agile approaches at a project or team level
	- Coverage of most popular agile approaches, as listed in industry surveys
	- Suitability factors to consider when choosing an agile approach and/or practice
	- Mapping agile to PMBOK® Guide processes and Knowledge Areas
	- Discussion on the use of agile beyond software development
	- Guidance, techniques, and approaches to consider when implementing agile in projects or organizations

### The Agile Manifesto: Notes start for day-1
	Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
	Working software over comprehensive documentation
	Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
	Responding to change over following a plan


### Based on above agile Manifesto, we have 12 principles

### Note:
	- Based on above Principles we can have many practices. Is agile an approach, a method, a practice, a technique, or a framework? Answer is any of this can be applied based on the situation. So agile is a blanket term for many approaches.
	- In general, there are two strategies to fulfill agile values and principles. The first is to adopt a formal agile approach, intentionally designed and proven to achieve desired results. Then take time to learn and understand the agile approaches before changing or tailoring them. Premature and haphazard tailoring can minimize the effects of the approach and thus limit benefits. 
	- The second strategy is to implement changes to project practices in a manner that fits the project context to achieve progress on a core value or principle. Use timeboxes to create features, or specific techniques to iteratively refine features. Consider dividing up one large project into several releases, if that works for the specific project context. Implement changes that will help the project succeed—the changes do not need to be part of the organization’s formal practices. The end goal is not to be agile for its own sake, but rather to deliver a continuous flow of value to customers and achieve better business outcomes.

### LEAN AND THE KANBAN METHOD:
	- One way to think about the relationship between lean, agile, and the Kanban Method is to consider agile and the Kanban Method as descendants of lean thinking. In other words, lean thinking is a superset, sharing attributes with agile and Kanban.
	- This shared heritage is very similar and focuses on delivering value, respect for people, minimizing waste, being transparent, adapting to change, and continuously improving. 
	- Project teams sometimes find it useful to blend various methods—whatever works for the organization or team is what should be done regardless of its origin. The objective is the best outcome regardless of the approach used.

### UNCERTAINTY, RISK, AND LIFE CYCLE SELECTION:
	- Some projects have considerable uncertainty around project requirements and how to fulfill those requirements using current knowledge and technology. These uncertainties can contribute to high rates of change and project complexity. 
	- As project uncertainty increases, so too does the risk of rework and the need to use a different approach. To mitigate the impact of these risks, teams select life cycles that allow them to tackle projects with high amounts of uncertainty via small increments of work.
	- Teams can plan and manage projects with clear and stable requirements and clear technical challenges with little difficulty. However, as the uncertainty in the project increases, the likelihood of changes, wasted work, and rework also increases, which is costly and time consuming.
	- Some teams have evolved project life cycles to use iterative and incremental approaches. Many teams discover that when they explore the requirements iteratively and deliver more often incrementally, the teams adapt to changes more easily. These iterative and incremental approaches reduce waste and rework because the teams gain feedback. These approaches use:
		* Very short feedback loops,
		* Frequent adaptation of process,
		* Reprioritization,
		* Regularly updated plans, and
		* Frequent delivery.
