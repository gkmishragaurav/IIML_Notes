### Agile Requirements Gathering:
- In a Nutshell:
story card -- conversation for understanding -- confirmation (write down what we have agreed)

### Q. What Is Requirements Gathering?
1. Requirements gathering is the process of collecting a project’s exact requirements from start to finish — including functional, non-functional, business, user, and regulatory requirements.
2. It’s an exploratory activity with the ultimate goal of defining all the product criteria in a PRD for the product development team to use as a blueprint. This document typically includes:
    - **Purpose —** Who it’s for and why you’re building it.
    - **Features —** What you’re building.
    - **Release/Acceptance Criteria —** What the requirement must have to be accepted by stakeholders
    - **Timeline —** Your goal for the release.

### Q. How is Agile Requirements Gathering Different?
- Traditional (Waterfall) project requirements are set early on in development, at which point they are reviewed and approved. Approved requirements don’t often change. Customer feedback does not usually inform requirements, and typically comes via bug fixes or features. The PRD clearly outlines what the requirements are, not why they need to be met.
- Conversely, Agile requirements adhere more to the Agile manifesto. For instance, they put the customer first by outlining what the requirements are and why they matter to the user or stakeholder in the form of a user story. 
- Gathering requirements is a collaborative process in which stakeholders review and update requirements throughout the development lifecycle. While, again, the process may not be purely Agile, requirements gathering should allow teams to embrace change, especially through frequent delivery and face-to-face conversations, for example.
- The Agile document usually lives through some sort of interactive document or task board that enables simplicity, whereas a traditional PRD is a static document. 

### Q. How to Gather Requirements?
- To cover your bases, you need to consult all necessary sources of your project requirements. These are typically stakeholders — including customers, users, administrators, business partners, compliance managers, and other relevant experts. You can obtain the information from them in a number of ways described below in the section on techniques.
- From a requirements management perspective, it may be helpful to look at the process of requirements gathering like this (and remember to maintain documentation!):
	1. Assign roles.
	2. Conduct stakeholder interviews.
	3. List requirements and expectations.
	4. Monitor and track requirements.
	5. Get feedback.

### Q. How to Make it Agile?
- Agile requirements gathering will be more collaborative, where developers will be included in conversations about what is needed and why. As mentioned above, the process will also take place throughout development when possible. 
- For those stringent requirements, like regulatory requirements, you may still need to follow a more traditional approach but include links to static documents within the user stories to define strict parameters. This is made easier by using a requirements management tool that accommodates hybrid Agile environments.
- The above list may be amended with principles from the Agile manifesto baked in:
	1. Have teams form groups.
	2. Ask customer for requirements (face-to-face when possible,) and deliver ASAP.
	3. Discuss via daily meetings of Business and Dev teams.
	4. Measure progress through working software.
	5. Continue to obtain feedback and embrace customer change. 
	6. Reflect and grow.

### Q. Requirements Gathering Techniques:
- When you have a list of relevant sources, there are a number of ways you can go about capturing the requirements. It’s good to use more than one approach so that you don’t miss anything. Here are five strong techniques to consider. 
	- **Brainstorming:**
		A good old-fashioned brainstorming session is certainly worth the effort. Participants talk about what they think is important without criticism or debate. After, a facilitator (usually the product owner) helps to reshape the ideas and then organizes and prioritizes them.
	- **Interviews or Questionnaires:**
		Talk directly to stakeholders about what problems the product solves, background information about business needs, and any other concerns to consider. If you can’t get a meeting in, a well-developed survey with open-ended questions can get you the information you need. (But in-person is preferred so the conversation is dynamic.)
	- **Review Similar or Current Systems:**
		If it’s possible to review the requirements and other system documentation from a similar system (or the current one you may be replacing,) this can provide a valuable framework to start with. 
	- **Observe or Work in the Target Environment:**
		If it’s feasible to submerge yourself in the user experience — either actively (participate yourself) or passively (ask questions while you observe someone else) — you may be able to get a better understanding of what’s required and also what should be improved upon.
	- **Talk to Support Teams:**
		Support engineers and help desks may be able to save you time by sharing problems and fixes that a similar or current project has needed in the past. Training and installation teams can shed light on what users find difficult about implementation. 

### Q. Agile Requirements Gathering Techniques:
- As mentioned above, the information you’re aiming to get still answers the basic outline of purpose, features, criteria, and timeline. Some differences lie in the way you will document, use the information, and potentially the way you organize or prioritize the requirements.
	- **Detail User Stories With Critical Links:**
		- Rather than create requirements statements, you’re describing what’s needed and why through user stories. 
		- When it comes to things like compliance, you need that information available without compromising the simplicity of the user story. In these cases, add links within the stories to pertinent documents. 
		- Additionally, you can provide acceptance criteria in the user stories to provide the right amount of detail. 
	- **Prioritize:**
		- It’s not that you don’t assign priorities in Waterfall; you do. But here you should still rely on your product owner to prioritize the user requirements and maintain a backlog like usual where possible. 
		- You may still use index cards, a Kanban board, or whatever Agile methodology makes your team successful.
	- **Track Status and Communication With Stakeholders:**
		- As you’re working through sprints and sharing updates with stakeholders, track feedback. It’s wise to use a tool that allows you to link their comments to the user stories.
	- **Use Prototypes:**
		- This is a great example of how Agile requirements gathering does not all happen before the project begins. You can get valuable information from stakeholders by sharing a demo or prototype before the build or final release. People don’t always know what they need until they see the end result, so you can save a lot of rework with a sneak peek.
	- **Use a Requirements Management Tool:**
		- This is exceptionally helpful for a couple of reasons. 
		- First, (and especially if compliance is of concern,) you can use a tool like Helix ALM,jira to have end-to-end traceability among your requirements, issues, and test cases. It’s more than handy when trying to maintain documentation in the anti-documentation world of Agile. 
		- Second, the tool should spare you the need for a manual template — and dropdowns and pre-populated fields will help you build user stories much more quickly.

### Template for Agile requirement geathering:
- **create a doc with these fields:**
    - Acceptance criteria
    - Scenarios
    - Design
    - Web/native
    - How to demo the user story
    - Mobile/tablet/desktop
    - All needed hardware/software available for testing
    - Platforms
    - Affected areas to test
    - Where/when needed to be delivered
    - PO/BA/Designers POC
    - Error handling
