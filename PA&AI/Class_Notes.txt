Business Analytics (BA) – is the act of bringing quantitative data to bear on decision making.
In simple terms --- is data visualization and reporting for understand “what happened and what is happening.
Benefits:
1. More Informed Decision-Making - data-driven decision-making
2. Improved Operational Efficiency

How BI based decision should be taken?
	A business decision should always be backed by data
	How to Collect this data?  ---- By identifying right KPIs
	What is a good KPI for business analysts?
		Agreed - all stakeholders should agree on the business analysts’ KPIs.
		Calibrated - scaled with expectations, scope and goals.
		Proper to the business environment - a KPI should be applicable to the relevant context of usage 
		Relevant to the assessment purpose - a KPI target purpose should be clearly stated - to predict  or to track  the business analysts’ work.
		Weighted – KPIs should have its own weight and priority may not weigh equally.
	
	How often the KPIs should be consumed and refined?
	There are two main cycles of consuming and refining KPIs:
		each deliverable should end up with retrospection of the achieved
		
		
automation vs autonomous:
	Automation refers to the ability of a system to control. Ex- a vehicle, like autopilot or cruise control.
	Autonomous is the ability of a system to not only control a vehicle but respond to unexpected hazards. An autonomous system, learns and adapts to dynamic environments, and evolves as the environment around it changes. 
	
4 phases of data analytics:
	analytics 1.0
	big data - 2.0
	big data + IOT - 3.0
	Autonomous - 4.0

	Outcome:
		Best possible decision and action

What is Data Warehousing?
	A Data Warehousing (DW) is process for collecting and managing data from varied sources to provide meaningful business insights.
	A Data warehouse is typically used to connect and analyze business data from heterogeneous sources. 

Properties of data warehousing:
	1. subject oriented - data warehousing process is proposed to handle with a specific theme which is more defined. These themes can be sales, distributions, marketing etc.
	2. Integrated – It is somewhere same as subject orientation which is made in a reliable format.  Integration means founding a shared entity to scale the all similar data from the different databases. The data also required to be resided into various data warehouse in shared and generally granted manner.
	3. Time-Variant – In this data is maintained via different intervals of time such as weekly, monthly, or annually etc. It founds various time limit which are structured between the large datasets and are held in online transaction process (OLTP). The time limits for data warehouse is wide-ranged than that of operational systems.
	4. Non-Volatile – As the name defines the data resided in data warehouse is permanent. It also means that data is not erased or deleted when new data is inserted. It includes the mammoth quantity of data that is inserted into modification between the selected quantity on logical business. It evaluates the analysis within the technologies of warehouse.

Database vs data warehouse
	- Database is a collection of related data that represents some elements of the real world whereas Data warehouse is an information system that stores historical and commutative data from single or multiple sources.
	- Database is designed to record data whereas the Data warehouse is designed to analyze data.
	- Database is application-oriented-collection of data whereas Data Warehouse is the subject-oriented collection of data.
	- Database uses Online Transactional Processing (OLTP) whereas Data warehouse uses Online Analytical Processing (OLAP).
	- Database tables and joins are complicated because they are normalized whereas Data Warehouse tables and joins are easy because they are denormalized.
	- ER modeling techniques are used for designing Database whereas data modeling techniques are used for designing Data Warehouse.
	
oltp vs opal:
	- oltp is an online transactional system. It manages database modification. OLAP is an online analysis and data retrieving process.
	- OLAP creates a single platform for all type of business analysis needs which includes planning, budgeting, forecasting, and analysis while OLTP is useful to administer day to day transactions of an organization.
	- OLAP is characterized by a large volume of data while OLTP is characterized by large numbers of short online transactions.
	- In OLAP, data warehouse is created uniquely so that it can integrate different data sources for building a consolidated database whereas OLTP uses traditional DBMS.
