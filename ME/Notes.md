### Economics notes: Class 1

Economics is the study of how societies use scarce recources to produce valuable goods and services and distribute them among different individuals.

#### ECONOMIC SCARCITY:
    The demand for a good or service is greater than the availability of the good or service. Therefore, scarcity can limit the choices available to the consumers who ultimately make up the economy.

#### The demand schedule:   
    Law of downward-sloping demand: 
        - When the price of a commodity is raised (and other things are held constant), buyers tend to buy less of the commodity. Similarly, when the price is lowered, other things being constant, quantity demanded increases.
        - Both common sense and careful scientific observation show that the amount of a commodity people buy depends on its price.
        - The higher the price of an article, other things held constant,1 the fewer units consumers are willing to buy. The lower its market price, the more units of it are bought.
        - There exists a definite relationship between the market price of a good and the quantity demanded of that good, other things held constant. This relationship between price and quantity bought is called the demand schedule, or the demand curve.

    Quantity demanded tends to fall as price rises for two reasons:
        - First is the substitution effect, which occurs because a good becomes relatively more expensive when its price rises. When the price of good A rises, I will generally substitute goods B, C, D, . . . for it. For example, as the price of beef rises, I eat more chicken.
        - A higher price generally also reduces quantity demanded through the income effect. This comes into play because when a price goes up, I find myself somewhat poorer than I was before. If gasoline prices double, I have in effect less real income, so I will naturally curb my consumption of gasoline and other goods

#### Forces behind the Demand Curve:
    A whole array of factors infl uences how much will be demanded at a given price:
        - The average income of consumers is a key determinant of demand. As people’s incomes rise, individuals tend to buy more of almost everything, even if prices don’t change. Automobile purchases tend to rise sharply with higher levels of income.
        - The size of the market—measured, say, by the population—clearly affects the market demand curve. California’s 40 million people tend to buy 40 times more apples and cars than do Rhode Island’s 1 million people.
        - The prices and availability of related goods influence the demand for a commodity. A particularly important connection exists among substitute goods—ones that tend to perform the same function, such as cornflakes and oatmeal, pens and pencils, small cars and large cars, or oil and natural gas. Demand for good A tends to be low if the price of substitute product B is low. (For example, as computer prices fell, what do you think happened to the demand for typewriters?)
        - In addition to these objective elements, there is a set of subjective elements called tastes or preferences. Tastes represent a variety of cultural and historical infl uences. They may refl ect genuine psychological or physiological needs (for liquids,love, or excitement). And they may include artificially contrived cravings (for cigarettes, drugs, or fancy sports cars). They may also contain a large element of tradition or religion (eating beef is popular in America but taboo in India, while curried jellyfish is a delicacy in Japan but would make many Americans gag).
        - Finally, special influences will affect the demand for particular goods. The demand for umbrellas is high in rainy Seattle but low in sunny Phoenix; the demand for air conditioners will rise in hot weather; the demand for automobiles will be low in New York, where public transportation is plentiful and parking is a nightmare.

#### Factors affecting the demand curve ----- Example for automobiles
    1. Average income ----- As incomes rise, people increase car purchases.
    2. Population ------ A growth in population increases car purchases.
    3. Prices of related goods ------ Lower gasoline prices raise the demand for cars.
    4. Tastes ------ Having a new car becomes a status symbol.
    5. Special influences ------ Special infl uences include availability of alternative forms of transportation, safety of automobiles, expectations of future price increases, etc.

#### Shifts in Demand:
    When there are changes in factors other than a good’s own price which affect the quantity purchased, we call these changes shifts in demand. Demand increases (or decreases) when the quantity demanded at each price increases (or decreases).

#### THE SUPPLY CURVE:
    The supply schedule (or supply curve) for a commodity shows the relationship between its market price and the amount of that commodity that producers are willing to produce and sell, other things held constant.

#### Forces behind the Supply Curve:
    Cost of production:
        - When production costs for a good are low relative to the market price, it is profitable for producers to supply a great deal. When production costs are high relative to price, firms produce little, switch to the production of other products, or may simply go out of business. 
        - Production costs are primarily determined by the prices of inputs and technological advances. The prices of inputs such as labor, energy, or machinery obviously have a very important infl uence on the cost of producing a given level of output. For example, when oil prices rose sharply in 2007, the increase raised the price of energy for manufacturers, increased their production costs, and lowered their supply. By contrast, as computer prices fell over the last three decades, businesses increasingly substituted computerized processes for other inputs, as for example in payroll or accounting operations; this increased supply.
        - An equally important determinant of production costs is technological advances, which consist of changes that lower the quantity of inputs needed to produce the same quantity of output. For example, manufacturers have become much more effi cient in recent years. It takes far fewer hours of labor to produce an automobile today than it did just 10 years ago.

    Prices of related goods:
        - Supply is also influenced by the prices of related goods, particularly goods that are alternative outputs of the production process. If the price of one production substitute rises, the supply of another substitute will decrease. The government has raised the subsidy on automotive ethanol to reduce imports of foreign oil. Ethanol is today primarily made from corn. The increased demand for corn (a shift in the demand curve for corn) increased the corn price. As a result, farmers planted corn instead of soybeans. The net result was that the supply of soybeans declined and soybean prices rose. All of this occurred because of a subsidy to reduce oil imports.

    Government policy:
        - Environmental and health considerations determine what technologies can be used, while taxes and minimum-wage laws can significantly affect input prices. Government trade policies have a major impact upon supply. For instance, when a free-trade agreement opens up the U.S. market to Mexican footwear, the total supply of footwear in the United States increases.

    Special influences:
        The weather exerts an important infl uence on farming and on the ski industry. The computer industry has been marked by a keen spirit of innovation, which has led to a continuous fl ow of new products. Market structure will affect supply, and expectations about future prices often have an important impact upon supply decisions.

#### Shifts in Supply:
    When changes in factors other than a good’s own price affect the quantity supplied, we call these changes shifts in supply. Supply increases (or decreases) when the amount supplied increases (or decreases) at each market price.

#### Factors affecting the supply curve ------ Example for automobiles
    1. Technology ---------- Computerized manufacturing lowers production costs and increases supply.
    2. Input prices ---------- A reduction in the wage paid to autoworkers lowers production costs and increases supply.
    3. Prices of related goods -------- If truck prices fall, the supply of cars rises.
    4. Government policy ---------- Removing quotas and tariffs on imported automobiles increases total automobile supply.
    5. Special influences ------------- Internet shopping and auctions allow consumers to compare the prices of different dealers more easily and drives high-cost sellers out of business.

#### EQUILIBRIUM OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND:
    - A market equilibrium comes at the price at which quantity demanded equals quantity supplied. At that equilibrium, there is no tendency for the price to rise or fall. The equilibrium price is also called the market-clearing price. This denotes that all supply and demand orders are filled, the books are “cleared” of orders, and demanders and suppliers are satisfied.
    - Shifts in the supply and demand curves change the equilibrium price and quantity. An increase in demand, which shifts the demand curve to the right, will increase both equilibrium price and quantity. An increase in supply, which shifts the supply curve to the right, will decrease price and increase quantity demanded.
    - To use supply-and-demand analysis correctly, we must
        (a) distinguish a change in demand or supply (which produces a shift of a curve) from a change in the quantity demanded or supplied (which represents a movement along a curve)
        (b) hold other things constant, which requires distinguishing the impact of a change in a commodity’s price from the impact of changes in other influences
        (c) look always for the supply-and-demand equilibrium, which comes at the point where forces acting on price and quantity are in balance.
