# economics notes:

economics is the study of how societies use scarce recources to produce valuable goods and services and distribute them among different individuals.

# The demand schedule:   
    - Both common sense and careful scientifi c observation show that the amount of a commodity people buy depends on its price.
    - The higher the price of an article, other things held constant,1 the fewer units consumers are willing to buy. The lower its market price, the more units of it are bought.
    - There exists a definite relationship between the market price of a good and the quantity demanded of that good, other things held constant. This relationship between price and quantity bought is called the demand schedule, or the demand curve.
