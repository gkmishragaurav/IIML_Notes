### Economics notes: Class 1

Economics is the study of how societies use scarce recources to produce valuable goods and services and distribute them among different individuals.

#### ECONOMIC SCARCITY:
    The demand for a good or service is greater than the availability of the good or service. Therefore, scarcity can limit the choices available to the consumers who ultimately make up the economy.

#### The demand schedule:   
    Law of downward-sloping demand: 
        - When the price of a commodity is raised (and other things are held constant), buyers tend to buy less of the commodity. Similarly, when the price is lowered, other things being constant, quantity demanded increases.
        - Both common sense and careful scientific observation show that the amount of a commodity people buy depends on its price.
        - The higher the price of an article, other things held constant,1 the fewer units consumers are willing to buy. The lower its market price, the more units of it are bought.
        - There exists a definite relationship between the market price of a good and the quantity demanded of that good, other things held constant. This relationship between price and quantity bought is called the demand schedule, or the demand curve.

    Quantity demanded tends to fall as price rises for two reasons:
        - First is the substitution effect, which occurs because a good becomes relatively more expensive when its price rises. When the price of good A rises, I will generally substitute goods B, C, D, . . . for it. For example, as the price of beef rises, I eat more chicken.
        - A higher price generally also reduces quantity demanded through the income effect. This comes into play because when a price goes up, I find myself somewhat poorer than I was before. If gasoline prices double, I have in effect less real income, so I will naturally curb my consumption of gasoline and other goods

#### Forces behind the Demand Curve:
    A whole array of factors infl uences how much will be demanded at a given price:
        - The average income of consumers is a key determinant of demand. As people’s incomes rise, individuals tend to buy more of almost everything, even if prices don’t change. Automobile purchases tend to rise sharply with higher levels of income.
        - The size of the market—measured, say, by the population—clearly affects the market demand curve. California’s 40 million people tend to buy 40 times more apples and cars than do Rhode Island’s 1 million people.
        - The prices and availability of related goods influence the demand for a commodity. A particularly important connection exists among substitute goods—ones that tend to perform the same function, such as cornflakes and oatmeal, pens and pencils, small cars and large cars, or oil and natural gas. Demand for good A tends to be low if the price of substitute product B is low. (For example, as computer prices fell, what do you think happened to the demand for typewriters?)
        - In addition to these objective elements, there is a set of subjective elements called tastes or preferences. Tastes represent a variety of cultural and historical infl uences. They may refl ect genuine psychological or physiological needs (for liquids,love, or excitement). And they may include artificially contrived cravings (for cigarettes, drugs, or fancy sports cars). They may also contain a large element of tradition or religion (eating beef is popular in America but taboo in India, while curried jellyfish is a delicacy in Japan but would make many Americans gag).
        - Finally, special influences will affect the demand for particular goods. The demand for umbrellas is high in rainy Seattle but low in sunny Phoenix; the demand for air conditioners will rise in hot weather; the demand for automobiles will be low in New York, where public transportation is plentiful and parking is a nightmare.

#### Factors affecting the demand curve ----- Example for automobiles
    1. Average income ----- As incomes rise, people increase car purchases.
    2. Population ------ A growth in population increases car purchases.
    3. Prices of related goods ------ Lower gasoline prices raise the demand for cars.
    4. Tastes ------ Having a new car becomes a status symbol.
    5. Special influences ------ Special infl uences include availability of alternative forms of transportation, safety of automobiles, expectations of future price increases, etc.

#### Shifts in Demand:
    When there are changes in factors other than a good’s own price which affect the quantity purchased, we call these changes shifts in demand. Demand increases (or decreases) when the quantity demanded at each price increases (or decreases).

#### THE SUPPLY CURVE:
    The supply schedule (or supply curve) for a commodity shows the relationship between its market price and the amount of that commodity that producers are willing to produce and sell, other things held constant.

#### Forces behind the Supply Curve:
    Cost of production:
        - When production costs for a good are low relative to the market price, it is profitable for producers to supply a great deal. When production costs are high relative to price, firms produce little, switch to the production of other products, or may simply go out of business. 
        - Production costs are primarily determined by the prices of inputs and technological advances. The prices of inputs such as labor, energy, or machinery obviously have a very important infl uence on the cost of producing a given level of output. For example, when oil prices rose sharply in 2007, the increase raised the price of energy for manufacturers, increased their production costs, and lowered their supply. By contrast, as computer prices fell over the last three decades, businesses increasingly substituted computerized processes for other inputs, as for example in payroll or accounting operations; this increased supply.
        - An equally important determinant of production costs is technological advances, which consist of changes that lower the quantity of inputs needed to produce the same quantity of output. For example, manufacturers have become much more effi cient in recent years. It takes far fewer hours of labor to produce an automobile today than it did just 10 years ago.

    Prices of related goods:
        - Supply is also influenced by the prices of related goods, particularly goods that are alternative outputs of the production process. If the price of one production substitute rises, the supply of another substitute will decrease. The government has raised the subsidy on automotive ethanol to reduce imports of foreign oil. Ethanol is today primarily made from corn. The increased demand for corn (a shift in the demand curve for corn) increased the corn price. As a result, farmers planted corn instead of soybeans. The net result was that the supply of soybeans declined and soybean prices rose. All of this occurred because of a subsidy to reduce oil imports.

    Government policy:
        - Environmental and health considerations determine what technologies can be used, while taxes and minimum-wage laws can significantly affect input prices. Government trade policies have a major impact upon supply. For instance, when a free-trade agreement opens up the U.S. market to Mexican footwear, the total supply of footwear in the United States increases.

    Special influences:
        The weather exerts an important infl uence on farming and on the ski industry. The computer industry has been marked by a keen spirit of innovation, which has led to a continuous fl ow of new products. Market structure will affect supply, and expectations about future prices often have an important impact upon supply decisions.

#### Shifts in Supply:
    When changes in factors other than a good’s own price affect the quantity supplied, we call these changes shifts in supply. Supply increases (or decreases) when the amount supplied increases (or decreases) at each market price.

#### Factors affecting the supply curve ------ Example for automobiles
    1. Technology ---------- Computerized manufacturing lowers production costs and increases supply.
    2. Input prices ---------- A reduction in the wage paid to autoworkers lowers production costs and increases supply.
    3. Prices of related goods -------- If truck prices fall, the supply of cars rises.
    4. Government policy ---------- Removing quotas and tariffs on imported automobiles increases total automobile supply.
    5. Special influences ------------- Internet shopping and auctions allow consumers to compare the prices of different dealers more easily and drives high-cost sellers out of business.

#### EQUILIBRIUM OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND:
    - A market equilibrium comes at the price at which quantity demanded equals quantity supplied. At that equilibrium, there is no tendency for the price to rise or fall. The equilibrium price is also called the market-clearing price. This denotes that all supply and demand orders are filled, the books are “cleared” of orders, and demanders and suppliers are satisfied.
    - Shifts in the supply and demand curves change the equilibrium price and quantity. An increase in demand, which shifts the demand curve to the right, will increase both equilibrium price and quantity. An increase in supply, which shifts the supply curve to the right, will decrease price and increase quantity demanded.
    - To use supply-and-demand analysis correctly, we must
        (a) distinguish a change in demand or supply (which produces a shift of a curve) from a change in the quantity demanded or supplied (which represents a movement along a curve)
        (b) hold other things constant, which requires distinguishing the impact of a change in a commodity’s price from the impact of changes in other influences
        (c) look always for the supply-and-demand equilibrium, which comes at the point where forces acting on price and quantity are in balance.

### Economics notes: Class 2

#### PRICE ELASTICITY OF DEMAND:
    - The price elasticity of demand (sometimes simply called price elasticity) measures how much the quantity demanded of a good changes when its price changes. The precise definition of price elasticity is the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price.
    - Goods vary enormously in their price elasticity, or sensitivity to price changes. When the price elasticity of a good is high, we say that the good has “elastic” demand, which means that its quantity demanded responds greatly to price changes. Goods that have ready substitutes tend to have more elastic demand than those that have no substitutes. If all food or footwear prices were to rise 20 percent tomorrow, you would hardly expect people to stop eating or to go around barefoot, so food and footwear demands are price-inelastic.
    - When the price elasticity of a good is low, it is “inelastic” and its quantity demanded responds little to price changes. if mad-cow disease drives up the price of British beef, people can turn to beef from other countries or to lamb or poultry for their meat needs. Therefore, British beef shows a high price elasticity.
    - The length of time that people have to respond to price changes also plays a role. A good example is that of gasoline. Suppose you are driving across the country when the price of gasoline suddenly increases. Is it likely that you will sell your car and abandon your vacation? Not really. So in the short run, the demand for gasoline may be very inelastic.
    - In the long run, however, you can adjust your behavior to the higher price of gasoline. You can buy a smaller and more fuel-effi cient car, ride a bicycle, take the train, move closer to work, or carpool with other people. 
    - The price elasticities of demand for individual goods are determined by the economic characteristics of demand. Price elasticities tend to be higher when the goods are luxuries, when substitutes are available, and when consumers have more time to adjust their behavior. By contrast, elasticities are lower for necessities, for goods with few substitutes, and for the short run.

#### Calculating Elasticities:
        Price elasticity of demand = ED = 
                percentage change in quantity demanded
                _____________________________________
                percentage change in price
                
    Note the use of averaging to calculate percentage changes in price and quantity. The formula for a percentage change is ΔP/P. The value of ΔP is clearly 20=110-90. But it’s not immediately clear what value we should use for P in the denominator. Is it the original value of 90, the final value of 110, or something in between? For very small percentage changes, such as from 100 to 99, it does not much matter whether we use 99 or 100 as the denominator. But for larger changes, the difference is significant. To avoid ambiguity, we will take the average price to be the base price for calculating price changes. we used the average of the two prices [P=(90+110)/2=100] as the base or denominator in the elasticity formula. Similarly, we used the average quantity [Q=(160+240)/2=200] as the base for measuring the percentage change in quantity.

#### Example for Calculating Elasticities:
    - The elasticity of a straight line at a point is given by the ratio of the length of the line segment below the point to the length of the line segment above the point. 
    - At the top of the line, a very small percentage price change induces a very large percentage quantity change and the elasticity is therefore extremely large.
    - elasticity is relatively large when we are high up the linear DD curve.
    - We use the rule to calculate the elasticity at point B in Figure 4-4. Calculate the ratio of the line segment BZ to the segment AB. Looking at the axes, we see that the ratio is 3. Therefore, price elasticity at point B is 3. A similar calculation at point R shows that demand at that point is inelastic, with an elasticity of 1⁄3. Finally, calculate elasticity at point M. Here, the ratio of the two line segments is one, so demand is unit-elastic at the midpoint M.
    - We can also use the rule to calculate the elasticity of a curved demand curve.For this case, you begin by drawing a line that is tangent to the point, and you then calculate the ratio of segments for the tangent line. This will provide the correct calculation of elasticity for the curved line.

#### ELASTICITY AND REVENUE
    - Total revenue is by defi nition equal to price times quantity (or P Q). If consumers buy 5 units at $3 each, total revenue is $15. If you know the price elasticity of demand, you know what will happen to total revenue when price changes.
        - When demand is price-inelastic, a price decrease reduces total revenue.
        - When demand is price-elastic, a price decrease increases total revenue.
        - In the borderline case of unit-elastic demand, a price decrease leads to no change in total revenue.

#### Factors Affecting Demand Elasticity:
    ease of substitution
    proportion of total expenditure
    durability/postponing purchase
    possibility of repair
    used product market
    length of the time period 
    
#### What Is Income Elasticity of Demand?
    - Income elasticity of demand refers to the sensitivity of the quantity demanded for a certain good to a change in the real income of consumers who buy this good.
    - High income elasticities, such as those for airline travel or yachts, indicate that the demand for these goods rises rapidly as income increases. 
    - Low income elasticities, such as for potatoes or used furniture, denote a weak response of demand to increases in income.
    - The formula for calculating income elasticity of demand is the percent change in quantity demanded divided by the percent change in income. With income elasticity of demand, you can tell if a particular good represents a necessity or a luxury.

        Point Income Elasticity = 
                % change in quantity demanded
                _____________________________
                % change in income

#### Arc elasticity measures the mid point between the two selected points:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49789867/156229648-59b78075-e0ba-4399-a113-22c2c1976b31.png)

#### Example of Difference between Point and Arc Elasticity A to B(look at pic given below):
    Point elasticity A to B:
        Quantity increase from 200 to 300 = 100/200 = 50%
        Price falls from 4 to 3 = 1/4 = -25%
        Therefore PED = 50/ -25 =  – 2.0

    Mid Point (Arc) Elasticity A to B:

        Mid point of Q = (200+300) / 2 = 250
        Mid Point of P = (3+4) / 2 = 3.5
        Q % = (100/250) = 40%
        P % = 1/3.5 = 28.57
        AE = 40/-28.57 = – 1.4

#### Fixed Cost:
    Fixed costs are expenses that must be paid even if the fi rm produces zero output. Sometimes called “overhead” or “sunk costs,” they consist of items such as rent for factory or offi ce space, interest payments on debts, salaries of tenured faculty, and so forth. They are fi xed because they do not change if output changes. For example, a law fi rm might have an office lease which runs for 10 years and remains an obligation even if the fi rm shrinks to half its previous size. Because FC is the amount that must be paid regardless of the level of output, it remains constant

#### Total cost:
    the lowest total dollar expense needed to produce each level of output q. TC rises as q rises. Fixed cost represents the total dollar expense that is paid out even when no output is produced; fixed cost is unaffected by any variation in the quantity of output. Variable cost represents expenses that vary with the level of output—such as raw materials, wages, and fuel—and includes all costs that are not fixed. Always, by definition,
    TC = FC + VC

#### Marginal cost:
    the extra or additional cost of producing 1 extra unit of output. Say a fi rm is producing 1000 compact discs for a total cost of $10,000. If the total cost of producing 1001 discs is $10,006, then the marginal cost of production is $6 for the 1001st disc.


#### Average or Unit Cost:   
    Average cost (AC ) is a concept widely used in business; by comparing average cost with price or average revenue, businesses can determine whether or not they are making a profi t. Average cost is the total cost divided by the total number of units produced,
    
<img width="406" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49789867/156412837-cb62b58b-3656-44ef-b073-e4e5a340118d.png">

#### Average fixed cost:
    defined as FC/q. Since total fixed cost is a constant, dividing it by an increasing output gives a steadily falling average fixed cost curve. In other words, as a firm sells more output, it can spread its overhead cost over more and more units.

#### Average variable cost (AVC ):
    equals variable cost divided by output, or AVC = VC/q. 

#### The Relation between Average Cost and Marginal Cost:
    1. When marginal cost is below average cost, it is pulling average cost down.
    2. When MC is above AC, it is pulling up AC.
    3. When MC just equals AC, AC is constant. At the bottom of a U-shaped AC, MC = AC = minimum AC
