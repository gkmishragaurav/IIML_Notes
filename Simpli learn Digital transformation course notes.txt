Driving a Digital Culture in an Organization:

Leaders should adopt risk-taking approach that empowers them to break self-imposed limits and uncover unforeseen opportunities

Digital Implementation:
	To successfully adopt a digital transformation, an organization must have a holistic mindset toward technological progress. The organization must embrace the transformation and integrate it in the daily tasks of team members. This digital Implementation and change in mindset can be categorized into four areas:

	Data Architecture - 
		● It plays a very important role in the creation of strategies from increasingly large and complex data volumes.
		● It refers to a set of rules and policies that govern and define the type of data collected.
		● It is stored and managed within an organization and governs its database.

		Data architecture is seen as a top challenge for digitizing business as most companies focus on getting the best technology without analyzing the need. This leads to redundant and inconsistent data storage. It causes overlapping functionality and lack of sustainability in the process.

		To effectively create an end-to-end data architecture, an organization must adopt an IT-supported digitization to:
			● Analyze current and future business requirements
			● Sketch a flexible data management architecture
			● Create a roadmap for implementation based on its business usage

		This approach is based on continuous delivery model. IT teams that specializes in cross-functional management, automate systems and optimize processes to release and iterate a software quickly and efficiently.

	Technology & Processes:
		● Digital implementation involves the process of integrating new technologies like Chatbots, Machine learning, and Big data to meet the changing needs of customers.
		● Marketing automation process is adopted to ensure the optimum utilization of resources.
		● Marketing automation is a software that automates the marketing process of an organization.
		● It ensures that marketing tasks are prioritized and executed in a more streamlined and efficient way.

	Organization:
		● Digital implementation in an organization is about analyzing and re-examining ways of doing business and being aware of new opportunities and threats to capitalize the emerging market.
		● Digital in an organization is about:
			o Creating value at the new frontiers of the business world
			o Creating value in the process of overall buyer’s journey that execute a vision of customer experiences
			o Building foundational capabilities in the form of technology to support the entire structure

	Marketing:
		● The marketing approach of digital implementation involves using digital technologies in the marketing of products and services, mainly on the Internet.
		● Digital integration with marketing enables organizations to provide personalized services to its customers across the marketing funnel stages.


Design Thinking:
	Design thinking is a system that uses the designer's sensibility and methods to match people's needs with what is technologically feasible and what a viable business can convert into consumer value and market opportunity.

	Design thinking steps out of the traditional boxes with visual thinking, creativity, and innovation in order to find new solutions to the same issues. The five stages of design thinking:

	1. Empathizing with users
	2. Defining the needs and problems of users and giving insights
	3. Ideating based on challenging assumptions and exploring ideas for innovative solutions
	4. Prototyping to start creating solutions
	5. Testing solutions

Case Study:- DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION: A ROADMAP FOR BILLION-DOLLAR ORGANIZATIONS Notes

How can senior executives successfully lead digital transformation?
	- Successful digital transformation comes not from implementing new technologies but from transforming your organization to take advantage of the possibilities that new technologies provide.
	- Major digital transformation initiatives are centered on re-envisioning customer experience, operational processes and business models.
	- Successful DT does not happen bottom up. It must be driven from the top.
	- Focus on the “how” more than the “what.” The most successful transformations we have seen focus as much (or more) on how to drive change as on the detailed content of the change. A compelling transformative vision, with related engagement, governance and KPIs will allow people throughout the enterprise to identify new “whats” to meet or extend the vision.
	- Successful DT comes not from creating a new organization, but from re-shaping the organization to take advantage of valuable existing strategic assets in new ways.
