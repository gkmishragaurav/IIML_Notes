Accounting notes:
Assets:
	- Assets are economic resources owned or controlled by a company that will provide future benefit to the company.
	- Examples include 
		- cash, that certainly provides a future benefit, 
		- inventory, items help to resell in the future, 
		- buildings and equipment
	- assets can be long-term or short-term. They can be tangible or intangible. They can be recorded at cost or at market value. But one thing is for certain, they represent a probable future benefit to the company.
	- Assets are reported on a company's balance sheet and are bought or created to increase a firm's value or benefit the firm's operations.
	
	Types of Assets:
		Current Assets:
			- Current assets are short-term economic resources that are expected to be converted into cash within one year. Current assets include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, inventory, and various prepaid expenses.
		Fixed Assets:
			- Fixed assets are long-term resources, such as plants, equipment, and buildings. An adjustment for the aging of fixed assets is made based on periodic charges called depreciation, which may or may not reflect the loss of earning powers for a fixed asset.
		Financial Assets:
			- Financial assets represent investments in the assets and securities of other institutions. Financial assets include stocks, sovereign and corporate bonds, preferred equity, and other hybrid securities. Financial assets are valued depending on how the investment is categorized and the motive behind it.
		Intangible Assets:
			- Intangible assets are economic resources that have no physical presence. They include patents, trademarks, copyrights, and goodwill. Accounting for intangible assets differs depending on the type of asset, and they can be either amortized or tested for impairment each year.
			
	Q. Is labor an asset?
		- No. Labor is the work carried out by human beings, for which they are paid in wages or a salary. Labor is distinct from assets, which are considered to be capital.
	
	Q. What exactly is an asset in balance sheet? 
		- Although the balance sheet summarizes the results of past transactions and events, its primary purpose is to help forecast the future. Hence the only items included as assets are those with implications for the future.
		-  That patent was purchased 10 years ago at a cost of $50,000. It may have been an asset 10 years ago, but because it now has no future economic benefit, it's not an asset now. 
		-  For example, a company will sometimes report a building as an asset on the balance sheet, when in fact the company has not actually purchased the asset, but only leased it under a long-term non-cancelable lease. If the lease gives the company control of the building for most of the building's economic life, then the leased building is reported as an asset.
		-  Some assets are reported at their historical cost, like buildings and equipment and land. It is tough in most cases to get at these assets' current market value, so we go with a measure that everyone can agree on. What was the original cost? You mean that the amounts listed on a balance sheet are not all comparable? Some are historical, some are current market value, and some are an estimate of future value? That's exactly what I mean. Amounts on the balance sheet are like fruit in a fruit basket. There are apples and there are oranges. But knowing that fact, there are different valuation measures, puts you ahead of many users of financial information. 
		
Liabilities:
	- A liability (generally speaking) is something that is owed to somebody else.
	- Liability can also mean a legal or regulatory risk or obligation.
	- In accounting, companies book liabilities in opposition to assets.
	- Current liabilities are a company's short-term financial obligations that are due within one year or a normal operating cycle (e.g. accounts payable).
	- Long-term (non-current) liabilities are obligations listed on the balance sheet not due for more than a year.
	
	Types of Liabilities:
		Current Liabilities:
			Ideally, analysts want to see that a company can pay current liabilities, which are due within a year, with cash. Some examples of short-term liabilities include payroll expenses and accounts payable, which include money owed to vendors, monthly utilities, and similar expenses. Other examples include:
			Wages Payable: The total amount of accrued income employees have earned but not yet received. 
			Interest Payable: Companies, just like individuals, often use credit to purchase goods and services to finance over short time periods. This represents the interest on those short-term credit purchases to be paid.
			Dividends Payable: For companies that have issued stock to investors and pay a dividend, this represents the amount owed to shareholders after the dividend was declared. This period is around two weeks, so this liability usually pops up four times per year, until the dividend is paid.
			Unearned Revenues: This is a company's liability to deliver goods and/or services at a future date after being paid in advance. This amount will be reduced in the future with an offsetting entry once the product or service is delivered.
			Liabilities of Discontinued Operations: This is a unique liability that most people glance over but should scrutinize more closely. Companies are required to account for the financial impact of an operation, division, or entity that is currently being held for sale or has been recently sold. This also includes the financial impact of a product line that is or has recently been shut down.
				
		Non-Current Liabilities:
			Considering the name, it’s quite obvious that any liability that is not current falls under non-current liabilities expected to be paid in 12 months or more. Long-term debt, also known as bonds payable, is usually the largest liability and at the top of the list. 
			Companies of all sizes finance part of their ongoing long-term operations by issuing bonds that are essentially loans from each party that purchases the bonds. This line item is in constant flux as bonds are issued, mature, or called back by the issuer.
			Analysts want to see that long-term liabilities can be paid with assets derived from future earnings or financing transactions. Bonds and loans are not the only long-term liabilities companies incur. Items like rent, deferred taxes, payroll, and pension obligations can also be listed under long-term liabilities. 
			
	Liabilities vs. Assets:
		Assets are the things a company owns—or things owed to the company—and they include tangible items such as buildings, machinery, and equipment as well as intangible items such as accounts receivable, interest owed, patents, or intellectual property.
		
		If a business subtracts its liabilities from its assets, the difference is its owner's or stockholders' equity. This relationship can be expressed as follows:

		Assets−Liabilities=Owner’s Equity

		However, in most cases, this accounting equation is commonly presented as such:

		Assets=Liabilities+Equity	
			
	Liabilities vs. Expenses
		An expense is the cost of operations that a company incurs to generate revenue. Unlike assets and liabilities, expenses are related to revenue, and both are listed on a company's income statement. In short, expenses are used to calculate net income. The equation to calculate net income is revenues minus expenses.

		For example, if a company has more expenses than revenues for the past three years, it may signal weak financial stability because it has been losing money for those years.

		Expenses and liabilities should not be confused with each other. One is listed on a company's balance sheet, and the other is listed on the company's income statement. Expenses are the costs of a company's operation, while liabilities are the obligations and debts a company owes. Expenses can be paid immediately with cash, or the payment could be delayed which would create a liability.

Owners' equity:
	- Owners' equity comes about as owners invest in the company with no obligation for the company to repay that investment, or the owners leave the profits generated by the company in the company.
	- In other words,  The remaining claim against the assets of a business after the liabilities have been deducted is owners' equity.

Assets = Owners' equity + Liabilities

-  Just as assets is comprised of a bunch of individual asset accounts, owners' equity is comprised of individual accounts as well. The two most common are paid-in capital and retained earnings.

Revenue- Expenses = Net income

Balance sheet:
	- The balance sheet is a listing of a company's assets, and its obligations, its liabilities. 
	- The balance sheet is structured around a phenomenal thing called the Accounting Equation.  Assets equal liabilities plus equity.
	Understanding Balance sheet:
		- describe the elements of the balance sheet: assets, liabilities, and equity;
		- describe uses and limitations of the balance sheet in financial analysis;
		- distinguish between current and non-current assets and current and non-current liabilities;
		- describe different types of assets and liabilities and the measurement bases of each;
		- describe the components of shareholders’ equity;
		- calculate and interpret liquidity and solvency ratios

Earnings management:
	Accounting policy guidelines —— rulebook —— INDUS(India), GAP(US) —— Auditors will check if these policies are followed.

- As all players are different, same rules can not apply on everyone.
- We have to define rules in such a way that one can have many interpretations. As businesses are different one set of rule can not be applied on diff players.
- Earnings management is that one can say we are doing well in market. 
- Managirial discretion is advised on subjective interpretation of accounting standards.

Q. What is difference between asset and expense ?
Ans - If a percived benefit from cost incurred is for more than one year its asset else its expense. 

Cost incurred on existing asset:
1. show it as expense 
2. Add it as asset
Decision rule — If cost incurred has changed the estimate useful life of asset add it to the balance sheet else income statement. capitalise on cost - B/S else income statement

Earnings management @ flipkart:
Traditional accounting:
	selling price - 120
	cost - 100
	discount - 30
	loss - 10 (on revenue)

What they are actually doing?
	revenue - 120 
	expense - 100 
	profit - 20 
	discount(asset) - 30 (capitalised customer accusation cost)

Q. Why managers get into Earnings management?
- To send Positive messege to market
- My own incentives are alligned to reported Profit.
- Firm get into EM before a major corporate event(IPO)—— in long run, EM is always bad.

Q. What Is Liquidity?
	- Liquidity refers to the efficiency or ease with which an asset or security can be converted into ready cash without affecting its market price. The most liquid asset of all is cash itself, while tangible items, such as real estate, fine art, and collectibles, are less liquid.

Q. Why Is Liquidity Important?
	- If markets are not liquid, it becomes difficult to sell or convert assets or securities into cash. You may, for instance, own a very rare and valuable family heirloom appraised at $150,000. However, if there is not market (i.e. no buyers) for your object, then it is irrelevant since nobody will pay anywhere close to its appraised value—it is very illiquid. It may even require hiring an auction house to act as a broker and track down potentially interested parties, which will take time and incur costs.

Q. What Are the Most Liquid Assets or Securities?
	- Cash is the most liquid asset followed by cash equivalents, which are things like money markets, CDs, or time deposits. 
	- Marketable securities such as stocks and bonds listed on exchanges are often very liquid and can be sold quickly via a broker. Gold coins and certain collectibles may also be readily sold for cash.

Q. What Is Depreciation?
	- The term depreciation refers to an accounting method used to allocate the cost of a tangible or physical asset over its useful life or life expectancy. 
	- Depreciation represents how much of an asset's value has been used. Depreciating assets helps companies earn revenue from an asset while expensing a portion of its cost each year the asset is in use.
	- for example, Assets such as machinery and equipment are expensive. Instead of realizing an asset's entire cost in year one, companies can use depreciation to spread out the cost and generate revenue from it. This is done through depreciation, which allows a company to write off an asset's value over a period of time, notably its useful life.

Q. What Is Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA)?
	- EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, is a measure of a company's overall financial performance and is used as an alternative to net income in some circumstances. 
	- EBITDA, however, can be misleading because it strips out the cost of capital investments like property, plant, and equipment.
	- This metric also excludes expenses associated with debt by adding back interest expense and taxes to earnings. Nonetheless, it is a more precise measure of corporate performance since it is able to show earnings before the influence of accounting and financial deductions.

Q. What operating activities might include?
	- Receipts from sales of goods and services
	- Interest payments
	- Income tax payments
	- Payments made to suppliers of goods and services used in production
	- Salary and wage payments to employees
	- Rent payments
	- Any other type of operating expenses


-------------------------------------- topics to understand CFS ends ---------------------------

Cash Flow Statements:
	- The statement of cash flows, or the cash flow statement (CFS), is a financial statement that summarizes the amount of cash and cash equivalents entering and leaving a company.Like the income statement, it also measures the performance of a company over a period of time. However, it differs because it is not as easily manipulated by the timing of non-cash transactions. The CFS measures how well a company manages its cash position, meaning how well the company generates cash to pay its debt obligations and fund its operating expenses. 

	- For example, the income statement includes depreciation expense, which does not have an actual cash outflow associated with it. It is simply an allocation of the cost of an asset over its useful life.

Q. How the Cash Flow Statement Is Used?
	- The CFS allows investors to understand how a company’s operations are running, where its money is coming from, and how money is being spent.
	- The CFS is important since it helps investors determine whether a company is on solid financial footing.
	- Creditors, on the other hand, can use the CFS to determine how much cash is available (referred to as liquidity) for the company to fund its operating expenses and pay down its debts.

Structure of the Cash Flow Statement ---- The main components of the cash flow statement are:

1. Cash from operating activities:
	- The operating activities on the CFS include any sources and uses of cash from business activities. In other words, it reflects how much cash is generated from a company’s products or services.
	- This will be constructed from balance sheet and PnL. Minimum req is to have 2yrs BS and 1 yr PnL.
	- in flow -- cash received from customer, this cash can belong to any time (mind not revenue)
	- out flow ---- cash paid to suppliers, service providers, employees, utilities, rent, insurance, tax --- basically actual cash paid.

2. Cash from Investing Activities:
	- Investing activities include any sources and uses of cash from a company’s investments. 
	- A purchase or sale of an asset, loans made to vendors or received from customers, or any payments related to a merger or acquisition are included in this category
	- Usually, changes in cash from investing are a “cash-out” item because cash is used to buy new equipment, buildings, or short-term assets such as marketable securities. However, when a company divests an asset, the transaction is considered “cash-in” for calculating cash from investing.
	- out flow --- cash paid to buy PPE, investments
	- in flow --- cash received on disposal of PPE, liquidation of assets.

3. Cash from Financing Activities:
	- Cash from financing activities includes the sources of cash from investors or banks, as well as the uses of cash paid to shareholders. Payment of dividends, payments for stock repurchases, and repayment of debt principal (loans) are included in this category.
	- in flow --- cash received from loans, equity including IPO.
	- Out flow --- cash paid in full payment of loans.

Limitations of the Cash Flow Statement:
	- Of course, not all cash flow statements always look healthy or exhibit a positive cash flow. However, negative cash flow should not automatically raise a red flag without further analysis. Poor cash flow is sometimes the result of a company’s decision to expand its business at a certain point in time, which would be a good thing for the future.
	- Therefore, analyzing changes in cash flow from one period to the next gives the investor a better idea of how the company is performing, and whether a company may be on the brink of bankruptcy or success. The CFS should also be considered in unison with the other two financial statements.

Let's try to make a CFS:
	Step 1 : Add net income from B/S
	Step 2 : What are additional cash received? add non operating expense, few examples:
			Depreciation
			anything coming from other income of BS
			decrease in account receivables 
			increase in account payables (liability side, my supplier gave me more time to pay)
			increase in Tax payables 
	Step 3 : subtraction from cash
			increase in inventory 
			decrease in payables
			increase in receivables
	Net income from operations = step 1 + step 2 - step 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Qualitative reporting analysis:
	- Qualitative analysis uses subjective judgment to analyze a company's value or prospects based on non-quantifiable information, such as management expertise, industry cycles, strength of research and development, and labor relations.
	- Qualitative analysis, on the other hand, deals with intangible, inexact concerns that belong to the social and experiential realm rather than the mathematical one.
ESG reporting --- All the ways by which Qualitative reporting is done.
	1. Environment / SUSTANABLE reporting --- reducing waste, saving energy, within office sustainable efforts 
	2. CSR reporting --- what kind of social impact one is making. 
	3. Corporate governance --- 
		composition of BOD 
			how many independent directors
			how many are executive directors
			No of meeting and attendance 
			remuneration
			Board minutes/agenda, discussions
			various committees --- auditors, risk management committee, remuneration committee
			CEO/Chairman duality
			give information of key investors and they have representation in board
		auditors, 

quantitative reporting --- mostly all numbers

BS, P&n, CF
accounting policies
measure financial ratios: --- ratio analysis
	1. Liquidity:
		How comfortable a firm is placed to meet it's short term obligations.
		current ratio = {current asset/current liability} = { (cash+ receivables + inventory)/(payables+expenses) }
		if this ratio is high this is good for organization. But catch is if this is too high then one will suffer on liquidity.

	2. Solvency:
		long term repayment obligation
		debt, equity ratio or leverage ratio = {Total long term debt / Total equity}
		This ratio should be as low as possible.

	3. Efficiency/turnover:
		how well one is managing it's assets 
		1. fixed asset turnover ratio:
					= { (sales*100) / fixed asset }
			for every 1 rupee of fixed asset, what is the revenue one is generating.
			9 out of 10 times, this ratio is wrong for projection of over utilization of assets.
		2. Inventory turnover:
			How fast your inventory is moving/sold.
			understand it on lines of BMW vs Maruti inventory turnover.
		3. Receivables turnover:
			How fast you are collecting it from customers. 

	4. Profitability:
		PAT*100/sales = NPM - net profit margin
		PAT*100/Total assets = ROA --- return on assets
		PAT*100/Total Equity = ROE ---- return on equity
		PAT/(total equity+total debt - current liability) = ROCE/ROI --- return on income

		Dupont equation:
			This eq. combines turnover and profitability.
			PAT/Total assets = (PAT/Total revenue)[Margin] X (Total revenue/ Total assets)[Turnover]
			profitability comes from either a Margin or turnover.
			Think on the lines that BMW is a Margin business while Maruti is a turnover business.

	5. Market/valuation:
		price to book value = { current stock market price / book value of equity }
		book value of equity(BVE) = { value of assets - value of liability }
		if we divide BVE with number of share we will get book value per share.

		(lets call it n) --- compare book value per share to current stock market price per share ----- this will reflect what is your market vs books.
		the value of n >= 1 is always good. 
		Can the value of n be less than 1? ----

Corporate Finance:
	- Includes any decisions made by a business that affect its finances
	Three major decisions:
		• Investments: Where should a firm invest its (scarce) resources?
			- project analysis
			- security analysis
		• Financing: How should the firm raise (additional) resources?
			- equity/debt/hybrids
			- long/short term
		• Dividend decision: What should the firm do with excess resources?
			- reinvest in business
			- distribute as dividends/return on capital 
			
	Q. Why do we need an objective function?
	Ans: How do you pick amongst alternatives? 
		 if multiple, how do you weight objectives, or prioritize?
		 
	Q. What’s a good objective function?
		- clear and unambiguous
		- measurable, in a clear and timely manner
		- should benefit firm’s long-term health and value
		
	Q. The real world – what can go wrong? 
		Stockholders hire managers to make decisions for them (separation of ownership and management), and borrow money from lenders who cannot monitor perfectly how the money is being used.
		
	Q. The real world conflicts 
	Stockholders – Managers:
	Assumption: Stockholders hire/fire managers and control their compensation, thereby exercising control and aligning interests.
	Reality: stockholders’ control over managers is often diluted, hence managers would put their interests over stockholders’.

	Managers – Financial Markets
	Assumption: Managers convey information to the markets in the truthful and timely manner, and the markets efficiently impound information into stock prices. 
	Reality: Information may be delayed or misleading (can you trust accounting numbers?), markets make mistakes and over react. Managers can manipulate information; insiders can manipulate market prices. 

	- Traditional corporate finance theory breaks down when The interests/objectives of the decision-makers in the firm conflict with the interests of stockholders.
