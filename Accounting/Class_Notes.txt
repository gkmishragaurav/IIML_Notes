Accounting notes:
	Assets:
		- Assets are economic resources owned or controlled by a company that will provide future benefit to the company.
		- Examples include 
			- cash, that certainly provides a future benefit, 
			- inventory, items help to resell in the future, 
			- buildings and equipment
		- assets can be long-term or short-term. They can be tangible or intangible. They can be recorded at cost or at market value. But one thing is for certain, they represent a probable future benefit to the company.
		- What exactly is an asset in balance sheet? 
			- Although the balance sheet summarizes the results of past transactions and events, its primary purpose is to help forecast the future. Hence the only items included as assets are those with implications for the future.
			-  That patent was purchased 10 years ago at a cost of $50,000. It may have been an asset 10 years ago, but because it now has no future economic benefit, it's not an asset now. 
			-  For example, a company will sometimes report a building as an asset on the balance sheet, when in fact the company has not actually purchased the asset, but only leased it under a long-term non-cancelable lease. If the lease gives the company control of the building for most of the building's economic life, then the leased building is reported as an asset.
			-  Some assets are reported at their historical cost, like buildings and equipment and land. It is tough in most cases to get at these assets' current market value, so we go with a measure that everyone can agree on. What was the original cost? You mean that the amounts listed on a balance sheet are not all comparable? Some are historical, some are current market value, and some are an estimate of future value? That's exactly what I mean. Amounts on the balance sheet are like fruit in a fruit basket. There are apples and there are oranges. But knowing that fact, there are different valuation measures, puts you ahead of many users of financial information. 
		
	Liabilities:
		- Liabilities are obligations that are satisfied either through payment or by providing services to someone else. 
		- Liabilities are formally defined as probable future sacrifices of economic benefits arising from present obligations of a particular entity to transfer assets or provide services to other entities in the future as a result of past transactions or events.
		- Most liabilities involve an obligation to transfer assets in the future.
		- past transactions or events. Assets and liabilities arise from transactions or events that have already happened. Consider a company that expects to pay $80,000 next year for the electricity that will use throughout the next year. If the world ends on December 31st of this year, does the company have to pay the $80,000? No, because the transaction, the actual use of the electricity, will not occur until next year. Thus, as of December 31st this year, the company would not report the $80,000 as a liability. There would be a liability however, if electricity had already been used but not yet paid for. 
		-  Liabilities are sources of the funds a company has used to acquire its assets. For example, businesses frequently buy goods on credit rather than paying cash, thus creating the liability called "accounts payable."
		- businesses often borrow money from banks and other lenders for various purposes such as purchasing land, new machinery or equipment, or additional merchandise. Now loans may be short term, less than a year, or long term. And unlike accounts payable, they usually require the payment of interest to the lender.
		- Now liabilities generally are grouped on the ballot sheet according to their due dates, with short term liabilities listed first.
		- 
		
	Owners' equity:
		- Owners' equity comes about as owners invest in the company with no obligation for the company to repay that investment, or the owners leave the profits generated by the company in the company.
		- In other words,  The remaining claim against the assets of a business after the liabilities have been deducted is owners' equity.
		
	Assets = Owners' equity + Liabilities
	
	-  Just as assets is comprised of a bunch of individual asset accounts, owners' equity is comprised of individual accounts as well. The two most common are paid-in capital and retained earnings.
	
	Revenue- Expenses = Net income
	
	Balance sheet:
		- The balance sheet is a listing of a company's assets, and its obligations, its liabilities. 
		- The balance sheet is structured around a phenomenal thing called the Accounting Equation.  Assets equal liabilities plus equity.
		Understanding Balance sheet:
			- describe the elements of the balance sheet: assets, liabilities, and equity;
			- describe uses and limitations of the balance sheet in financial analysis;
			- distinguish between current and non-current assets and current and non-current liabilities;
			- describe different types of assets and liabilities and the measurement bases of each;
			- describe the components of shareholdersâ€™ equity;
			- calculate and interpret liquidity and solvency ratios
