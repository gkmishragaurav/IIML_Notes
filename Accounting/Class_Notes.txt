Accounting notes:
Assets:
	- Assets are economic resources owned or controlled by a company that will provide future benefit to the company.
	- Examples include 
		- cash, that certainly provides a future benefit, 
		- inventory, items help to resell in the future, 
		- buildings and equipment
	- assets can be long-term or short-term. They can be tangible or intangible. They can be recorded at cost or at market value. But one thing is for certain, they represent a probable future benefit to the company.
	- Assets are reported on a company's balance sheet and are bought or created to increase a firm's value or benefit the firm's operations.
	
	Types of Assets:
		Current Assets:
			- Current assets are short-term economic resources that are expected to be converted into cash within one year. Current assets include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, inventory, and various prepaid expenses.
		Fixed Assets:
			- Fixed assets are long-term resources, such as plants, equipment, and buildings. An adjustment for the aging of fixed assets is made based on periodic charges called depreciation, which may or may not reflect the loss of earning powers for a fixed asset.
		Financial Assets:
			- Financial assets represent investments in the assets and securities of other institutions. Financial assets include stocks, sovereign and corporate bonds, preferred equity, and other hybrid securities. Financial assets are valued depending on how the investment is categorized and the motive behind it.
		Intangible Assets:
			- Intangible assets are economic resources that have no physical presence. They include patents, trademarks, copyrights, and goodwill. Accounting for intangible assets differs depending on the type of asset, and they can be either amortized or tested for impairment each year.
			
	Q. Is labor an asset?
		- No. Labor is the work carried out by human beings, for which they are paid in wages or a salary. Labor is distinct from assets, which are considered to be capital.
	
	Q. What exactly is an asset in balance sheet? 
		- Although the balance sheet summarizes the results of past transactions and events, its primary purpose is to help forecast the future. Hence the only items included as assets are those with implications for the future.
		-  That patent was purchased 10 years ago at a cost of $50,000. It may have been an asset 10 years ago, but because it now has no future economic benefit, it's not an asset now. 
		-  For example, a company will sometimes report a building as an asset on the balance sheet, when in fact the company has not actually purchased the asset, but only leased it under a long-term non-cancelable lease. If the lease gives the company control of the building for most of the building's economic life, then the leased building is reported as an asset.
		-  Some assets are reported at their historical cost, like buildings and equipment and land. It is tough in most cases to get at these assets' current market value, so we go with a measure that everyone can agree on. What was the original cost? You mean that the amounts listed on a balance sheet are not all comparable? Some are historical, some are current market value, and some are an estimate of future value? That's exactly what I mean. Amounts on the balance sheet are like fruit in a fruit basket. There are apples and there are oranges. But knowing that fact, there are different valuation measures, puts you ahead of many users of financial information. 
		
Liabilities:
	- A liability (generally speaking) is something that is owed to somebody else.
	- Liability can also mean a legal or regulatory risk or obligation.
	- In accounting, companies book liabilities in opposition to assets.
	- Current liabilities are a company's short-term financial obligations that are due within one year or a normal operating cycle (e.g. accounts payable).
	- Long-term (non-current) liabilities are obligations listed on the balance sheet not due for more than a year.
	
	Types of Liabilities:
		Current Liabilities:
			Ideally, analysts want to see that a company can pay current liabilities, which are due within a year, with cash. Some examples of short-term liabilities include payroll expenses and accounts payable, which include money owed to vendors, monthly utilities, and similar expenses. Other examples include:
				Wages Payable: The total amount of accrued income employees have earned but not yet received. 
				Interest Payable: Companies, just like individuals, often use credit to purchase goods and services to finance over short time periods. This represents the interest on those short-term credit purchases to be paid.
				Dividends Payable: For companies that have issued stock to investors and pay a dividend, this represents the amount owed to shareholders after the dividend was declared. This period is around two weeks, so this liability usually pops up four times per year, until the dividend is paid.
				Unearned Revenues: This is a company's liability to deliver goods and/or services at a future date after being paid in advance. This amount will be reduced in the future with an offsetting entry once the product or service is delivered.
				Liabilities of Discontinued Operations: This is a unique liability that most people glance over but should scrutinize more closely. Companies are required to account for the financial impact of an operation, division, or entity that is currently being held for sale or has been recently sold. This also includes the financial impact of a product line that is or has recently been shut down.
				
		Non-Current Liabilities:
			Considering the name, it’s quite obvious that any liability that is not current falls under non-current liabilities expected to be paid in 12 months or more. Long-term debt, also known as bonds payable, is usually the largest liability and at the top of the list. 
			Companies of all sizes finance part of their ongoing long-term operations by issuing bonds that are essentially loans from each party that purchases the bonds. This line item is in constant flux as bonds are issued, mature, or called back by the issuer.
			Analysts want to see that long-term liabilities can be paid with assets derived from future earnings or financing transactions. Bonds and loans are not the only long-term liabilities companies incur. Items like rent, deferred taxes, payroll, and pension obligations can also be listed under long-term liabilities. 
			
	Liabilities vs. Assets:
		Assets are the things a company owns—or things owed to the company—and they include tangible items such as buildings, machinery, and equipment as well as intangible items such as accounts receivable, interest owed, patents, or intellectual property.
		
		If a business subtracts its liabilities from its assets, the difference is its owner's or stockholders' equity. This relationship can be expressed as follows:

		Assets−Liabilities=Owner’s Equity

		However, in most cases, this accounting equation is commonly presented as such:

		Assets=Liabilities+Equity	
			
	Liabilities vs. Expenses
		An expense is the cost of operations that a company incurs to generate revenue. Unlike assets and liabilities, expenses are related to revenue, and both are listed on a company's income statement. In short, expenses are used to calculate net income. The equation to calculate net income is revenues minus expenses.

		For example, if a company has more expenses than revenues for the past three years, it may signal weak financial stability because it has been losing money for those years.

		Expenses and liabilities should not be confused with each other. One is listed on a company's balance sheet, and the other is listed on the company's income statement. Expenses are the costs of a company's operation, while liabilities are the obligations and debts a company owes. Expenses can be paid immediately with cash, or the payment could be delayed which would create a liability.

Owners' equity:
	- Owners' equity comes about as owners invest in the company with no obligation for the company to repay that investment, or the owners leave the profits generated by the company in the company.
	- In other words,  The remaining claim against the assets of a business after the liabilities have been deducted is owners' equity.

Assets = Owners' equity + Liabilities

-  Just as assets is comprised of a bunch of individual asset accounts, owners' equity is comprised of individual accounts as well. The two most common are paid-in capital and retained earnings.

Revenue- Expenses = Net income
	
Balance sheet:
	- The balance sheet is a listing of a company's assets, and its obligations, its liabilities. 
	- The balance sheet is structured around a phenomenal thing called the Accounting Equation.  Assets equal liabilities plus equity.
	Understanding Balance sheet:
		- describe the elements of the balance sheet: assets, liabilities, and equity;
		- describe uses and limitations of the balance sheet in financial analysis;
		- distinguish between current and non-current assets and current and non-current liabilities;
		- describe different types of assets and liabilities and the measurement bases of each;
		- describe the components of shareholders’ equity;
		- calculate and interpret liquidity and solvency ratios
			
Corporate Finance:
	- Includes any decisions made by a business that affect its finances
	Three major decisions:
		• Investments: Where should a firm invest its (scarce) resources?
			- project analysis
			- security analysis
		• Financing: How should the firm raise (additional) resources?
			- equity/debt/hybrids
			- long/short term
		• Dividend decision: What should the firm do with excess resources?
			- reinvest in business
			- distribute as dividends/return on capital 
			
	Q. Why do we need an objective function?
	Ans: How do you pick amongst alternatives? 
		 if multiple, how do you weight objectives, or prioritize?
		 
	Q. What’s a good objective function?
		- clear and unambiguous
		- measurable, in a clear and timely manner
		- should benefit firm’s long-term health and value
		
	Q. The real world – what can go wrong? 
		Stockholders hire managers to make decisions for them (separation of ownership and management), and borrow money from lenders who cannot monitor perfectly how the money is being used.
		
		Q. The real world conflicts 
		Stockholders – Managers:
		Assumption: Stockholders hire/fire managers and control their compensation, thereby exercising control and aligning interests.
		Reality: stockholders’ control over managers is often diluted, hence managers would put their interests over stockholders’.
		
		Managers – Financial Markets
		Assumption: Managers convey information to the markets in the truthful and timely manner, and the markets efficiently impound information into stock prices. 
		Reality: Information may be delayed or misleading (can you trust accounting numbers?), markets make mistakes and over react. Managers can manipulate information; insiders can manipulate market prices. 
		
		- Traditional corporate finance theory breaks down when The interests/objectives of the decision-makers in the firm conflict with the interests of stockholders.
