Walmart balance sheet understanings:

	Understanding Assets:
	
	Q. What Are Cash and Cash Equivalents (CCE)?
	Ans - Cash and cash equivalents refers to the line item on the balance sheet that reports the value of a company's assets that are cash or can be converted into cash immediately. Cash equivalents include bank accounts and marketable securities, which are debt securities with maturities of less than 90 days. However, oftentimes cash equivalents do not include equity or stock holdings because they can fluctuate in value. Walmart has 6.8 billion dollars in cash worldwide. That is cash in cash registers and bank accounts. 
	
	- Accounts receivable (AR) is the balance of money due to a firm for goods or services delivered or used but not yet paid for by customers. Accounts receivables are listed on the balance sheet as a current asset. AR is any amount of money owed by customers for purchases made on credit. Walmart has 5.6 billion dollars as AR
	
	- An important asset is inventory, which is the stuff on the shelves that Walmart has to sell to you. The amount is 44 billion dollars, which is about four million dollars per store for the 10,000 plus stores that Walmart has around the world.
	
	- There is a 108 billion dollar amount listed for property and equipment, which means that Walmart has spent that much to buy land, and trucks, and buildings.
	
	- Walmart's total assets on January 31st, 2018, were just over 204 billion dollars.
	
	- So, our natural question should be, where did Walmart get the money to buy that 204 billion dollars in assets? The explanation comes in the other part of the balance sheet, the listing of liabilities and owners' equity. 
	
	- The value of goodwill typically arises in an acquisition—when an acquirer purchases a target company. The amount the acquiring company pays for the target company over the target’s net assets at fair value usually accounts for the value of the target’s goodwill.
	
	- deferred charges: The term deferred charges refers to previously incurred liabilities that are not due within the current accounting period.
	
	Understanding Liabilities:
	- Now there are two general sources of money to buy assets. You can borrow the money, or the money can be invested by shareholders.
	
	- A large source of financing for Walmart is supplier credit. Walmart was allowed by its suppliers to purchase its inventory on credit. In fact, the 46 billion dollars in accounts payable means that with inventory of 44 billion dollars, Walmart has already sold some inventory, for which the company has not yet paid.
	
	- Walmart also has borrowed a lot of money on a long-term basis, over 30 billion dollars worth. But the largest single-source of financing by Walmart, 85 billion dollars, is something called retained earnings. Retained earnings is the amount of profits generated by Walmart that have been kept in the company to purchase new assets.
	
	Understanding Equity:
	
	Shareholders’ Equity=Total Assets−Total Liabilities
